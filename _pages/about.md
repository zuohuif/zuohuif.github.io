# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #
I'm **Zuohui Fu**, a Research Scientist at Meta. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, under the supervision of [Prof. Gerard de Melo](http://gerard.demelo.org/) and co-advised by [Prof. Yongfeng Zhang](http://yongfeng.me/). I received M.S. degree from University of Notre Dame in 2017. Before that, I received B.S. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT) in 2014.

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval and Human-centered Machine Learning, with the emphasis on Dialogue Systems, Knowledge Graphs, Recommender Systems with Explainability, Fairness, Causality and Human-AI Interactions etc.
